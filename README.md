# Churn Prediction - Olist Brazilian E-Commerce

> Predicting customers who are unlikely to place another order within the next 90 days, enabling early retention actions.

---

## Problem Statement

Most e-commerce platforms struggle with customer retention. This project builds a machine learning model to identify at-risk customers early, so business teams can take targeted retention actions before losing them.

**Churn Definition:** A customer who has not placed an order within 90 days after their last purchase.

## Dataset

[Olist Brazilian E-Commerce](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce) — 100k+ orders from 2016–2018, structured across 9 relational tables.

| Table | Description |
|---|---|
| olist_orders | Main order data |
| olist_order_items | Items per order |
| olist_order_payments | Payment method & value |
| olist_order_reviews | Customer reviews & ratings |
| olist_customers | Customer data |
| olist_products | Product data |
| olist_sellers | Seller data |
| olist_geolocation | Geolocation data (zip code coordinates) |
| product_category_name_translation | Product category name (PT → EN) |

## Methodology

1. **Data Loading & Merging** — Load 9 CSV tables, merge into `master.csv`
2. **Churn Labeling** — Define churn as no order within 90 days → `is_churned`
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis** — RFM analysis, distributions, trends, correlations
4. **Feature Engineering** — Build meaningful features for modeling
5. **Modeling** — Train Random Forest & XGBoost, handle class imbalance
6. **Evaluation** — Optimize for ROC-AUC and F1-Score

---
**Key Findings from EDA:**
- Churn rate: **89.9%** — severe class imbalance
- **96.9%** of customers made only 1 purchase (one-time buyers)
- **Recency** is the only feature significantly correlated with churn (r = 0.47)
- Review score and monetary value show almost no difference between churned vs non-churned customers

## Tech Stack

- **Python** — Pandas, NumPy
- **Visualization** — Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Modeling** — Scikit-learn, XGBoost
- **Environment** — Jupyter Notebook, VS Code
